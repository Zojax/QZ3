Installation
============

The easiest method is to deploy work environment using [virtual machine](https://github.com/Zojax/zojax-dev-box). All the necessary dependences will be installed automatically.
### 1. Before up


On Mac OS X, you do not need to do anything, NFS is already installed.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you just need to install the NFS package:

    $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common nfs-kernel-server


### 2. Adding new box


    $ git clone git@github.com:Zojax/zojax-dev-box.git zojaxbox

    $ cd zojaxbox

    $ vagrant up


### 3. Mounting code from box


    $ vagrant ssh

    (box) $ sudo tee -a /etc/exports <<<'/home/vagrant/zojax      *(rw,async,all_squash,insecure,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check)'>/dev/null

    (box) $ sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart

    (box) $ logout


#### for your Ubuntu:


    $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common

    $ mkdir /home/YOUR-USER/workspace/zojax

    $ sudo tee -a /etc/fstab <<<'192.168.33.10:/home/vagrant/zojax  /home/USER/workspace/zojax/files  nfs   rw,async 0 0'>/dev/null

    $ sudo mount /home/YOUR-USER/workspace/zojax


#### for your MacOS:


In Finder, go to: `Go â†’ Connect to Server...` and, in the **Server Address box**, enter:

    nfs://192.168.33.10/home/vagrant/zojax


or use nfs manager

    192.168.33.10:/home/vagrant on /Users/USER/workspace/zojax/files (nfs, nodev, nosuid, automounted, noowners)


### 4. Copy your ssh Key


Assuming you have SSH keys on your host machine, you should be able to copy them to the VM with

    $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa vagrant@192.168.33.10:~/.ssh/id_rsa

*password: vagrant*


### 5. git settings


Set up your email in Git:

    (box) $ git config --global user.name "Your Name" # Set your name

    (box) $ git config --global user.email "your-mail@gmail.com" # Set an email


### Vagrant commands


1. Stop VM:

        $ vagrant halt

        [default] Attempting graceful shutdown of linux...


2. Start VM again:

        $ vagrant up


3. Delete VM:

        $ vagrant destroy

## Setting up QZ3


Go to your virtual machine

    $ vagrant ssh

Go to `zojax` folder

    (box) $ cd zojax/

Clone the project:

    (box) $ git clone git@github.com:Zojax/QZ3.git quick.site

    (box) $ cd quick.site

buildout:

    (box) $ /usr/bin/python2.5 bootstrap.py -d -v 1.5.2

    (box) $ bin/buildout


### Work with Instance


Run Instance in the Foreground mode:

    (box) $ bin/instance fg

NOTE: To suspend the instance running in the foreground, press CTRL-c

or you can use:

    (box) $ bin/instance start

    (box) $ bin/instance restart

    (box) $ bin/instance stop

Check the log:

    (box) $ tail -f parts/instance/z3.log -n100


### Open site in a browser


You should  be able now to browse to  URL http://192.168.33.10:8080/ and log in using the default account:

    Login: manager

    Password: V0qGfh0km
